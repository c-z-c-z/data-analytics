## Repository contents
The repository for this project contains an extensive writeup, original code I wrote for this study, and a .csv file containing the raw data. The paper was originally self-published in January 2022 and underwent minor revisions in November 2023.
## Status
Initial study completed. Future work in this area is planned, namely increasing sample size dramatically to tease apart various correlations that were unable to be comprehensively analyzed in this study and applying aspects of the dataset to a machine learning context
